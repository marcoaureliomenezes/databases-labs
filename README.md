# Databases Studies

This repository is the consolidated material that I use during the period I am trying to master my skills in Databases, both SQL and NoSQL.
It aggregatesknowledge that I've acquired during the last year I will use so much in the future. The material part of this repo includes:

- Texts about Database Theory and Data Modeling theory and specific DBMS studies, which I've collected during my studies. These texts I intend to return periodically trying to improve them with a better understanding after some time, studies and reflexions.

- Material needed to build Labs and try to practice some concepts and languages.
